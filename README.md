Project Scenario

Every company wants to increase its profit or revenue margin and customer retention is one key area industry players focus their resources. In today's world of machine learning, most companies build classification models to perform churn analysis on their customers. 

Classification in machine learning and statistics is a supervised learning approach in which the computer program learns from the data given to it and makes new observations or classifications. The main goal is to identify which class/category the new data will fall into. 

For example, we can classify a bank transaction into Fraud or Non - Fraud category or an email into Spam or Non - Spam.



Data for this project

The data for this projects has been divided into 3. The first 2 data sets are for training and evaluation the machine learning model  while the last data set is for testing the model. Please keep this in mind



First Data Set

The first 3000 records of the dataset can be found in a database you will have to access remotely



server name: dap-projects-database.database.windows.net
user: LP2_project
password: Stat$AndD@t@Rul3
database name: dapDB
table name: dbo.LP2_Telco_churn_first_3000


Please note that you only have read privileges which mean you will not be able to insert, delete or update the table in the database. The Database Management System for this project is MIRCORSOFT SQL SERVER. You should connect to the database using an Open Database Connectivity standard library like pyodbc, or an Object-Relational Mapping library SQLAlchemy. Note that you cannot use the read_csv() method in this case. You can find a notebook on how to do this in this GitHub Repository.



Second Data Set

The second part of the data is hosted on this GitHub Repository in a file called LP2_Telco-churn-second-2000.csv. 



Testing Data Set

The final 2000 records of the data set needed for this project can be found in this OneDrive. The filed is named Telco-churn-last-2000.xlsx. 

Please note that this is your test dataset. This Dataset will be used for testing the accuracy of your models. 



Project Rubrics

The Sprint's rubrics can be found on this GitHub Repository, and further explanations of the features can also be found in this repository. Please read them carefully.



In this Project, you will: 

1. Learn more about classification models and help the client, a telecommunication company, to understand their data.
2. Find the lifetime value of each customer and know what factors affect the rate at which customers stop using their network.
3. Predict if a customer will churn or not.
 
Skill sets you will build:
1. Data Exploration
2. Missing value computations
3. Feature engineering.
4.Creating interactive dashboards using Power BI or Tableau
4. Building robust machine learning pipelines using Machine Learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest etc.
5. Model Evaluation and Interpretation using LIME, SHAP techniques
6 . Model Optimization and hyperparameter tuning.
