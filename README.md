The project involves analyzing a dataset from a telecommunications company to predict which customers were likely to churn. 

Steps:

Data Collection and Cleaning:
Obtained a comprehensive customer dataset that included demographic information, service usage, and account details.
Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted EDA to identify key factors influencing customer churn. Visualized trends and patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Discovered that contract type, tenure, and monthly charges were significant predictors of churn.

Feature Engineering and Model Development:
Created new features such as the average monthly charges and the number of services subscribed.
Developed a machine learning models to predict the probability of churn.
